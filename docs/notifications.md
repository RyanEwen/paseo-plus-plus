# Notifications

Use `notification-open` for OS notification taps. It owns delivery, parsing,
process-local deduplication, startup readiness, and native acknowledgement.
Keep agent and workspace navigation in their existing navigation modules.
Import the pure API from `@/notification-open` and the app-shell component from
`@/notification-open/react`; senders must not load the React routing runtime.

Agent payloads name a host and agent. Ignore their workspace hint when opening:
the agent can move after a notification is sent. Use `navigateToAgent`, which
uses the current store record or the agent route to resolve the workspace from
the host. Terminal payloads name their workspace and use `navigateToWorkspace`.

See [agent targets and deferred opens](expo-router.md#agent-targets) for route
ownership and workspace recovery. Notification generation, presence, and push
eligibility remain daemon concerns.

## Native delivery

Keep the router instance at module scope. Android's `singleTask` Activity can
finish on Back while its JS context remains alive. A React ref is lost when the
root remounts; process-local handled IDs must survive that remount.

Clear `lastNotificationResponse` after dispatch. Reading a launch response does
not acknowledge it. Without clearing it, a later Activity launch can reopen the
old agent.

With expo-notifications 57, Android also replays its pending response list to
new native listeners. Clearing the last response does not drain that list.
Deduplication covers listener registration within one JS context. A development
JS reload creates another context and can replay a cold-launch response; do not
add persisted handled IDs to compensate. Recheck this limitation when upgrading
expo-notifications.

iOS drains pending responses when its delegate first handles them. Push data
read by Expo arrives under `userInfo.body`; simulator payloads must match:

```json
{
  "aps": { "alert": { "title": "Agent finished", "body": "Open the agent" }, "sound": "default" },
  "body": {
    "serverId": "host",
    "workspaceId": "workspace",
    "agentId": "agent",
    "reason": "finished"
  }
}
```

An Android FCM launch intent needs `google.message_id` and a JSON `body` extra.
An arbitrary Activity launch with data extras does not exercise Expo's FCM path.

Foreground pushes remain in Notification Center without a banner or sound.
This preserves notifications sent with stale presence information.

## Viewed chat

A notification for the chat you are looking at is skipped, and delivered ones for it are dismissed. A chat counts as viewed only when its pane is focused, ready and in the foreground; on compact layouts the agent pane must also be settled at rest (`mobile-panels/rest.ts`). `notifications/seen-agent.ts` owns the app side; `packages/desktop/src/features/viewed-agent-notifications/` owns Electron.

Both sides gate on visibility. The renderer knows which chat is painted; only the main process knows whether its window is visible and focused, and it receives notifications the renderer never created (Windows Notification Center history after a restart). The renderer reports its chat with a revision so a late report cannot replace a newer one.

A pending native show cannot be cancelled by closing the JS `Notification`. A dismissal requested before `show` waits for the show callback.

Windows exposes Notification Center history only through WinRT, which Electron does not wrap. `packages/desktop/src/features/windows-toast-history.ts` runs a PowerShell script that verifies the installer shortcut's app user model ID before reading or removing anything, and reads the current and the legacy (`electron.app.Paseo++`) namespaces. Only packaged Windows builds with an explicit app user model ID have history; other builds skip it.

## Startup and verification

Wait for the root navigator, host registry, remembered selection, and startup
redirects before handing off a tap. A compact agent route must demand the host's
directory itself; its sidebar can be closed for the entire cold launch.

Verify warm and cold taps, stale and missing workspace hints, two distinct taps,
and Android Back followed by launcher reopen or a different notification tap. Check the focused tab and every
workspace's saved layout, since a foreign pinned tab survives navigation.
Use the daemon's payload shape on both iOS and Android; a browser event alone
does not test native replay or acknowledgement.

Existing foreign pins belong to the reconciliation fix in
[#6900](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/issues/6900). Desktop main-process window
selection is tracked separately in
[#6875](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/issues/6875).
